     <h5>Dry steam: Hygienic cleanliness and maximum protection for your textiles</h5>
  <p>Thermostar Dry steam system: thanks to its Thermostar technology, the steam is heated up in the boiler before the cleaning to up to 174 °C. One of the biggest advantages compared with a customary steam cleaner: the steam produced through the high temperature is very dry and is also suited very well for the cleaning of textiles, like beds, carpets and upholstered furniture. The textiles do not become wet, cannot burn and no moisture stains stay behind. Also, the impregnation is preserved in spite of the application of the steam cleaner. One also receives a deep cleaning that greatly reduces the number of mites, which is very practical, above all for allergy sufferers and their health.</p>
    <p>The Thermostar heating elements with 28W/cm2, in contrast to the standard heating elements (approx. 7W/cm2), exhibit a much better productivity. The heating element itself is not in direct contact with the water. It is sheathed with a special alloy and therefore has maximum heat performance. Another feature of the Thermostar heating element is that it expands with rising temperature. This has the result that the limescale coating formed on the heating element drops off. We can call our heating element “self decalcifying”. Moreover, a longer service life can thereby be achieved. The Thermostar steam boiler guarantees simple replacement of the heating element. Thus not the entire steam boiler must be replaced in case of a possible defect.</p>
    <p>Through the use of the high temperature, the Thermostar dry steam cleaner manages to kill germs and bacteria, to remove greases easily and simply and to clean rough as well as smooth surfaces hygienically. The selection of which cleaning product is suitable or not is therefore obsolete. The cleaning is done only through water vapour thanks to the steam cleaner. You need no chemicals, no cleaning products, and you clean in a cheap, healthy and environmentally-friendly way!</p>
   <h5>Here again are the advantages briefly at a glance:</h5>
   <ul>
<li>germs and bacteria are killed</li>
<li>even greases are dissolved</li>
<li>textiles, rough and smooth surfaces, hygienically clean!</li>
<li>high level of cleanliness</li>
<li>no chemicals and/or cleaning products – cheap and environmentally-friendly</li>
<li>textiles are only slightly moistened</li>
<li>no burning, no moisture stains</li>
<li>impregnation is preserved</li>
<li>self-decalcifying system</li>
<li>long service life</li></ul>
   <h5>Thermostar Dry steam cleaner system is available in 2 different versions:</h5>
   <ul>
<li>Thermostar Avantgarde</li>
<li>Thermostar Professional</li></ul>
   <p>Therefore you can select the version suitable for you according to your requirements. Thus, there is the optimal solution for everyone. The Thermostar Dry steam cleaner has a professional technology and yet thanks to its compact size it is still ideally suitable for domestic use.</p>

      <p>More than 100,000 units of the Thermostar Dry Steam Cleaner have been sold all over the world thanks to its multiple benefits and excellent cleaning.

  <div class="col">
   <h5>Intelligent technology</h5>
   <p>An independent method was invented for the Thermostar Dry Steam Cleaner, which is responsible for the very dry steam and a long lifespan of usage. The technology of this invention is now being used all over the world.</p>

   <div class="col-sm-8">
    <h6>The steam boiler is made of stainless steel and has heating elements that can be taken apart.</h6>
    <p>The boiler is produced exclusively from AISI 304 stainless steel, a durable, resistant steel that can withstand temperatures up to 600°C. The production is done by specialised technicians with a special welding process called Tungsten Inert Gas, and it is welded together and tested with up to 70 bar pressure. The welding process is distinguished from other fusion welding processes through a number of advantages, because practically no weld spatters arise, therefore the health burden from welding fumes is low when using this method.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
   <div class="row">
   <div class="col-sm-8">
    <h6>The Dry Steam Cleaner has a self-decalcifying heating element.</h6>
    <p>These elements have four times as much power as spiral heating elements (28 instead of 7W/cm2 on average). They have a very long service life and can be replaced, in contrast to most spiral heaters.
Sheathed with a special alloy, it provides maximum power and the fastest possible heating of the water for a continuously high steam temperature. When the temperature rises, it expands and thus dissolves the limescale. The self-decalcifying electromechanical float provides a consistently high temperature throughout.</p>

    <h6>The steam never runs out</h6>
    <p>Thermostar offers you a continuous steam 24/7. As a result of this professional standard technology, it hardly needs any maintenance. An operating hours meter is integrated as well as a self-controlled temperature indicator. In addition, special rubber sleeves on the water pump extend the life duration of the valves.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="row">
     <div class="col text-center">
    <h6>True Temp Technology and two chamber system.</h6> </div>
    <p>The electromagnetical float in the Thermostar ensures a high quality steam during the whole service life. The electronic sensors used by customary steam devices already become calcified after a short time and therefore the exchange of information is disturbed – the result is moist steam. Through the two chamber system, the steam cleaner is also refillable at any time, even at full operating temperature. This means that no cooling down period is necessary anymore for water replenishment and therefore unnecessary waiting periods are a thing of the past!</p>

<h5>Thermostar - a sustained invention</h5>
<p>More than 30 years ago a pioneering invention was made in Italy, the land of steam! The foundation of modern Thermostar was a revolutionary boiler and an interchangeable heating element. Since then the requirements on technology and standard of living increased continuously - and so did the Thermostar!</p>

    <p>Do you feel the same way sometimes? Sometimes, just looking at people, one might get the impression that nature belongs to us. In reality, we are also just a part of it. The future belongs to our children. Therefore, we at Thermostar try to prevent mountains of waste wherever possible. And, we have found a way that makes sense, both ecologically and economically.</p>
    <p>This is because products for life only have to bought once and only disposed of once!</p>

    <p>Thermostar products are not available through conventional retail channels. They have a very high quality standard with extraordinary guarantee services.</p>
